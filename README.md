# ðŸ“š On-Chain Educational Video Library

## ðŸ“– Description
The **On-Chain Educational Video Library** is a decentralized smart contract built on the **Aptos blockchain**. It allows educators and content creators to upload educational videos, requiring users to hold a certain amount of tokens to access them. This ensures fair compensation for creators while providing learners with high-quality content in a secure, permissionless environment.

## ðŸŽ¯ Vision
The vision of this project is to create a **decentralized and token-gated learning ecosystem**, where knowledge sharing is transparent, immutable, and rewarding for both educators and learners. By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to eliminate intermediaries and provide direct access to premium educational content.

## ðŸš€ Future Scope
1. **NFT-Based Access** - Introducing NFT-based premium subscriptions for exclusive content.
2. **Multi-Tier Pricing** - Different token levels for different courses based on difficulty and content quality.
3. **Community Voting** - Allowing the community to decide which videos get featured or rewarded.
4. **Decentralized Storage** - Storing videos using **IPFS or Arweave** for better decentralization and permanence.
5. **Cross-Chain Compatibility** - Expanding the project to support multiple blockchains for wider accessibility.
